# Intro
Hello, My name is Alex Guo, and I am currently a student at the University of Iowa. I was motivated to undertake this project after seeing someone code Tetris 
using flow. This entire project was coded from scratch using the Processing Java framework that I learned how to use from Khan Accadamy. 

I decided to use GitHub as my version control solution half way through the project to better doccument
my progress. 

In order for the project to work, you MUST add core.jar (processing) as a library!
